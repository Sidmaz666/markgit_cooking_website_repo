# Samosa Recipe

## Ingredients:
- 2 cups of all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup of vegetable oil
- 1/2 teaspoon of salt
- 1/4 cup of water
- 2 medium-sized potatoes, peeled and diced
- 1/2 cup of frozen peas
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 1 green chili, finely chopped
- 1/2 teaspoon of cumin seeds
- 1/2 teaspoon of coriander powder
- 1/4 teaspoon of garam masala
- Salt to taste
- Oil for deep frying

## Directions:
1. In a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, salt, and vegetable oil. Mix well and gradually add water to make a firm dough. Cover and set aside for 30 minutes.
2. In a pan, heat some oil and add the cumin seeds. Once the cumin seeds start to splutter, add the chopped onions and green chili. Saute until the onions turn translucent.
3. Add the diced potatoes and peas. Mix well and cook for a few minutes.
4. Add the coriander powder, garam masala, and salt to taste. Mix well and cook until the potatoes are soft and fully cooked.
5. Remove from heat and let the filling cool down.
6. Preheat oil for deep frying in a pan.
7. Divide the dough into equal-sized balls and roll out each ball into a thin circle.
8. Cut each circle in half and form a cone with each half.
9. Fill the cones with the potato-peas mixture and seal the edges with a little water.
10. Deep fry the samosas until they are golden brown and crispy.
11. Serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce.
